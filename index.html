        <p>Red Abbey Resort is special. We strive to create a unique experience by taking you away from the hustle and bustle of the city to &ldquo;a place untouched by time&rdquo;. Upon your arrival our butler Mr. Carson will greet you with your room key and take your bags. From there you may choose to relax immediately in the Foyer Lounge while our attentive staff fixes your drinks, or retire immediately with the option of private dining directly in your room. Guests also enjoy strolling through our vast gardens, or unwinding on the rooftop conservatory. No matter how you choose to spend your time at the Red Abbey Resort, rest assured that you will enjoy the timeless luxury of a place untouched by the demands of the world. </p>
